# NumberGuessingGame
I was tired of listening about this project in my college years. Finally, I learned the logic and created one myself. Number guessing gsme will generate a random number in a range from 0 to a particular number that you decide, you'll have to guess the random number. You will get the clues about the number wheter it is greater than or less than the generated number. The program makes you guess until you finally predict the correct number. In the emd it tells you the number of guesses it took for you to get it right.
